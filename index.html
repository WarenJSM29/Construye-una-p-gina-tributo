                <h4>Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing</h4>
                <ul>

                        <strong>1886</strong> - He founded his own company, Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing. Investors disagreed with his plans for the development of an alternating current motor, relieving him of his position at the company.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Alternating current</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1888</strong> - During 1888, his first practical system design for generating and transmitting alternating current for electrical power systems took place...
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ...Nikola Tesla's alternating current (AC) is a type of electrical current in which the direction of the current is periodically reversed. This means that current alternates between flowing in one direction and then flowing in another. AC is the most common type of electrical current used in the world today...
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ...He developed the alternating current induction motor, eliminating the commutator and ignition brushes of direct current motors and introduced improvements in the field of transmission and generation of alternating current energy, noting that both the generation and transmission of this they could be obtained much more efficiently with an alternating current than in the case of direct current, the most commonly used at that time...
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ...The rights to this invention, momentous at the time, were bought by the American inventor <a id="ul-links" href="https://www.buscabiografias.com/biografia/verDetalle/1839/George%20Westinghouse" target="_blank">George Westinghouse</a>, who showed the system for the first time at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago (1893). Two years later Tesla's AC motors were installed in the Niagara Falls Electric Power Design.
                    </li>

                        <strong>1893</strong> - Nikola Tesla designed a wireless communication system and built an antenna over 30 meters high, the Wardencliff Tower, with which he intended to transmit electrical energy wirelessly, with the same operating principle as radio.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Inventions</h4>

                        <strong>1894/1895</strong> - A year later, experimenting with discharge tubes, he realized that "invisible radiation" appeared, later called X-rays, which damaged photographic film stored nearby. He continued to investigate this line, but all his work was lost in a fire in his laboratory in March 1895.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1898</strong> - He patented more than 700 inventions such as an electric submarine in 1898 and a small ship that would capture energy emitted by the Wardencliff Tower that would be stored in its batteries...

                    <li>
                        ...In the opinion of some Serbian scientists, the Sojourner's operating system is based on the patent for the electric submarine designed by Tesla.

                    <li>
                        In 1898 he developed and registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office the first remote control electrical device. He presented it in December of that same year at an electricity fair. With which he managed a small boat wirelessly, to the astonishment of the public. The device would be the forerunner of drones and the remote control of the TV.
